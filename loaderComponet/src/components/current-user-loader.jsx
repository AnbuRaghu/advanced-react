/*notes
CurrentUserLoader is a React component that takes children as props. children represents whatever child elements are passed between <CurrentUserLoader>...</CurrentUserLoader>.

 React.Children.map is used to iterate over each child element passed to CurrentUserLoader.
For each child, React.isValidElement(child) checks if itâ€™s a valid React element (e.g., not plain text).
If the child is a valid element, React.cloneElement(child, { user }) is used to clone the child element and pass down the user data as a prop.
we can pass props as second argument to the  cloneElement() method.
This way, each child of CurrentUserLoader will receive the user data as a prop.
