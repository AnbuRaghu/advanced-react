Error Boundaries in React are special components designed to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire React application. They help improve user experience by preventing the entire application from breaking due to errors in specific components.

Key Features of Error Boundaries
Error Catching:

Error boundaries catch errors during:
Rendering.
Lifecycle methods.
Constructors of child components.
They do not catch errors in:
Event handlers.
Asynchronous code (e.g., setTimeout, fetch).
Server-side rendering.
Errors thrown inside the error boundary itself.
Fallback UI:

When an error is caught, error boundaries display a fallback UI instead of the crashed component tree.
Separation of Concerns:

They allow you to isolate error handling logic and fallback UI for specific parts of your app.
How to Create an Error Boundary
Error boundaries are implemented using class components because they rely on specific lifecycle methods: componentDidCatch and static getDerivedStateFromError.

Hereâ€™s an example:

Step 1: Create an Error Boundary
jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state to display the fallback UI
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Log the error or send it to an error reporting service
    console.error("Error caught in ErrorBoundary:", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
Step 2: Use the Error Boundary
Wrap parts of your application with the ErrorBoundary component:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary';
import SomeComponent from './SomeComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <SomeComponent />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
If an error occurs inside SomeComponent or its children, the error boundary will display the fallback UI ("Something went wrong.").
