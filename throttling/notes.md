throttling
------------

In the context of React, throttling is a performance optimization technique used to limit the rate at which a function can be called, particularly for event handlers that might be triggered frequently. Here's a more detailed explanation:
Throttling in React
Throttling in React is commonly used to control how often a function is executed, especially for events like scrolling, resizing, or typing that can fire rapidly.
Key Concepts:
Rate Limiting: Throttling ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time period, regardless of how many times it's invoked.
Performance Optimization: It helps in reducing the number of expensive operations (like API calls or complex calculations) that might otherwise be triggered too frequently.
Event Handling: Particularly useful for scroll, resize, and input events which can fire many times per second.
Implementation:
Throttling can be implemented using custom hooks or libraries like Lodash. Here's a basic example of a throttle function:

```javascript

// this is custom throttle function that ia a highrer order function which takeaÂ´s a function and wait as params and returns another function
export const throttle = (fn, wait) => {
  let timerId;
  let inThrottle;
  let lastTime;
  return (...args) => {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      lastTime = Date.now();
      inThrottle = true;
    } else {
      clearTimeout(timerId);
      timerId = setTimeout(() => {
        if (Date.now() - lastTime >= wait) {
          fn(...args);
          lastTime = Date.now();
        }
      }, Math.max(wait - (Date.now() - lastTime), 0));
    }
  };
};


```




 <!-- This code defines a throttle function that limits how often a given function can be called. Let's break it down step by step: -->

```javascript
export const throttle = (fn, wait) => {
  let timerId;
  let inThrottle;
  let lastTime;

  return (...args) => {
    // Function body
  };
};
```

1. The `throttle` function takes two parameters:
   - `fn`: The function to be throttled
   - `wait`: The minimum time (in milliseconds) between function calls

2. Three variables are declared:
   - `timerId`: To store the ID of the setTimeout
   - `inThrottle`: A flag to indicate if we're currently in a throttle period
   - `lastTime`: To store the timestamp of the last function execution

3. The function returns another function that takes any number of arguments (`...args`).

Now, let's look at the returned function's body:

```javascript
if (!inThrottle) {
  lastTime = Date.now();
  inThrottle = true;
} else {
  clearTimeout(timerId);
  timerId = setTimeout(() => {
    if (Date.now() - lastTime >= wait) {
      fn(...args);
      lastTime = Date.now();
    }
  }, Math.max(wait - (Date.now() - lastTime), 0));
}
```

4. If `inThrottle` is false (first call or after the wait period):
   - Set `lastTime` to the current timestamp
   - Set `inThrottle` to true

5. If `inThrottle` is true (within the wait period):
   - Clear any existing timeout
   - Set a new timeout:
     - If the time elapsed since `lastTime` is greater than or equal to `wait`:
       - Call the original function `fn` with the provided arguments
       - Update `lastTime` to the current timestamp
     - The timeout is set to the remaining time in the wait period, or 0 if that time has already passed

This implementation ensures that the function is called immediately on the first invocation, and then at most once per `wait` period thereafter, always using the most recent arguments provided.
