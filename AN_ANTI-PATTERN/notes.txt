------
why should you avoid creating components inside other compopnents?? why is this parctice is known as an anti-pattern???

const App =() => {
    const Input = () => <input/> // input is defined inside App comppnent 
    return <Input/>>

};


// what the app component look like in react 
{
 type:Input
    
 }

 Answer: creating components within other components in this way can significanly reduce performancr of your react app
