React provides two powerful optimization tools: useMemo and memo (React.memo). While both aim to improve performance, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

## useMemo

useMemo is a React Hook that memoizes the result of a computation between re-renders. It's particularly useful for optimizing expensive calculations within a component.

**Key features:**
- Caches the result of a function call
- Re-computes only when specified dependencies change
- Used inside functional components

**Usage:**
```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

In this example, `computeExpensiveValue` will only re-run if `a` or `b` changes[1][4].

## memo (React.memo)

memo is a higher-order component that memoizes an entire component, preventing unnecessary re-renders when its props remain unchanged.

**Key features:**
- Wraps a component to optimize its rendering
- Performs a shallow comparison of props
- Used to create an optimized version of a component

**Usage:**
```javascript
const MemoizedComponent = memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Component logic
});
```

This creates a memoized version of MyComponent that only re-renders when its props change[1][3].

## Differences

1. **Scope:** useMemo focuses on memoizing specific values or calculations within a component, while memo memoizes an entire component[2][5].

2. **Application:** useMemo is used for expensive computations inside a component, whereas memo is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components based on prop changes[2][6].

3. **Implementation:** useMemo is a hook used inside functional components, while memo is a higher-order component that wraps the entire component[6].

By understanding and correctly applying both useMemo and memo, developers can significantly optimize React applications, ensuring smooth performance and efficient resource utilization[1][2].
